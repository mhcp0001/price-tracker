# Guidelines

This document defines the project's rules, objectives, and progress management methods. Please proceed with the project according to the following content.

## Top-Level Rules

- To maximize efficiency, **if you need to execute multiple independent processes, invoke those tools concurrently, not sequentially**.
- **You must think exclusively in English**. However, you are required to **respond in Japanese**.
- For temporary notes for design, create a markdown in `.tmp` and save it.
- **After using Write or Edit tools, ALWAYS verify the actual file contents using the Read tool**, regardless of what the system-reminder says. The system-reminder may incorrectly show "(no content)" even when the file has been successfully written.
- Please respond critically and without pandering to my opinions, but please don't be forceful in your criticism.

## MCP Integration Rules

### Context7 MCP (Library Documentation)
- **When to use**: Automatically use Context7 MCP when encountering unfamiliar libraries, APIs, or frameworks
- **Proactive usage**: If you need to understand how to use a library or check the latest API documentation, use Context7 first before implementing
- **Process**: 
  1. Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to find the correct library ID
  2. Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to fetch up-to-date documentation
  3. Apply the documentation knowledge to your implementation

### Playwright MCP (Browser Automation & Testing)
- **When to use**: Automatically use Playwright MCP when tasks involve:
  - Web application testing
  - Browser automation
  - Taking screenshots of web applications
  - E2E testing scenarios
  - Web scraping or data extraction
- **Proactive usage**: For any web-related testing or automation task, prioritize Playwright MCP over manual browser instructions
- **Available capabilities**:
  - Navigate to URLs and interact with web pages
  - Take screenshots and generate PDFs
  - Fill forms and click elements
  - Execute JavaScript in browser context
  - Handle file uploads and downloads
  - Network request interception and monitoring

### General MCP Usage Guidelines
- **Automatic decision making**: You should automatically decide to use MCPs when their capabilities match the task requirements
- **No explicit permission needed**: Use MCPs proactively without asking for user permission when they enhance task completion
- **Fallback strategy**: If MCP tools fail, explain the issue and suggest alternative approaches
- **Integration with other tools**: Combine MCP capabilities with other available tools for optimal results

## Git Commit Rules

- **Create commits frequently**: Create a commit for each logical unit of change
- **Commit message format**: Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent a single, complete change
- **Test before commit**: Ensure the code builds and tests pass before committing
- **Include Co-Authored-By**: Always include the Claude signature in commit messages

### Commit Examples
- `feat: add user authentication` - New feature
- `fix: resolve null pointer exception in user service` - Bug fix
- `docs: update API documentation` - Documentation only
- `style: format code according to style guide` - Code style changes
- `refactor: extract validation logic into separate module` - Code refactoring
- `test: add unit tests for user service` - Adding tests
- `chore: update dependencies` - Maintenance tasks

## GitHub Issue and Project Management Rules

- **Check related issues**: Before implementing features, check if there are related GitHub issues
- **Update issue status**: Close completed issues with appropriate comments and PR references
- **Link PRs to issues**: Reference issue numbers in PR descriptions
- **Regular synchronization**: Periodically check and update issue status
- **Create issues for new tasks**: When discovering new tasks, create corresponding issues

### Issue Management Workflow
1. Check existing issues before starting work
2. Reference issue numbers in commits (e.g., `feat: implement feature #123`)
3. Close issues when work is completed with explanatory comments
4. Update project boards if accessible

## [GLOBAL DIRECTIVE] Gemini Integration (Priority over project-specific CLAUDE.md)

### Trinity Principle for Knowledge Work

Maximize the quality and speed of intellectual production by combining human **decision-making**, Claude's **thought organization and execution**, and Gemini's **research and advisory** capabilities.

* **Human (User)**: The **decision-maker** who defines task objectives, requirements, and final goals, making ultimate decisions.
    * Capable of setting abstract goals but less adept at breaking them down into concrete tasks or systematic information organization.
* **Claude (You)**: The **primary facilitator** who understands user intent, structures thinking, and handles task decomposition, management, and execution.
    * Excels at following instructions methodically and executing tasks systematically, but has limited access to external real-time information and objective multi-perspective validation.
* **Gemini**: The **specialist advisor** providing access to current and comprehensive information through web search, expert knowledge, and diverse perspectives.
    * Strong at granular information gathering, fact-checking, and objective analysis, but not designed to understand overall task context or drive plans autonomously.

### Basic Workflow

1. **PROMPT Generation**
   Claude consolidates user requirements into a single text and stores it in environment variable `$PROMPT`

2. **Gemini CLI Invocation**
```bash
gemini <<EOF
$PROMPT
EOF
```
3. **Result Integration**
    Present Gemini's response
    Add Claude's additional analysis and commentary

### Collaboration Protocol (Revised: Claude-Led Second Opinion Approach)
#### Phase 1: Claude-Led Thought Organization & Analysis
* Begin with thorough consideration and hypothesis formation by Claude
* Organize task requirements, consider approaches, break down challenges, and create a clear thinking framework
* Clearly distinguish between your analysis results and areas requiring clarification or verification

#### Phase 2: Requesting Gemini's Second Opinion

* Consult Gemini based on Claude's analysis in these cases:
  * Gathering current/specialized information requiring search capabilities
  * Multi-perspective validation needed for analyses or judgments
  * Objective validity checks required for strategies or plans
  * Idea brainstorming or expanding creative thinking
* Present specific questions and verification points when consulting Gemini

#### Phase 3: Integration and Final Judgment
* Utilize Gemini's responses as a second opinion and integrate with Claude's analysis
* Formulate final judgments and recommendations aligned with user intent
* Critically evaluate Gemini's information rather than accepting it uncritically

### Primary Use Cases
1. Information Gathering & Research: Collect current, specialized, or niche information that Claude cannot access independently.
   * Example: "Research the latest AI market trends, including major players and technology developments"

2. Assumption & Strategy Validation: Verify the validity of task assumptions and approaches from an objective perspective.
   * Example: "Confirm whether this analytical approach can achieve our initial objectives and identify any potential concerns"

3. Idea Brainstorming: Obtain multi-perspective feedback on new plans or ideas to expand creative thinking.
   * Example: "Suggest additional approaches for our internal communication enhancement event proposal"
  
4. Structure & Planning Development: Create outlines and structural frameworks for reports, presentations, and projects.
    * Example: "Help develop a new service proposal by identifying necessary components and creating a draft structure"

5. Problem Analysis & Solution Development: Analyze problem causes from multiple angles and explore a broad range of solution options.
   *  Example: "List potential factors causing workflow inefficiencies from tool, process, and cultural perspectives"

6. Document & Output Review: Review created documents, materials, and plans from an objective standpoint to identify improvements.
   *  Example: "Review this report draft and suggest improvements for better logic and persuasiveness"
7. Task Decomposition: Break down large, abstract tasks into executable concrete steps and create actionable plans.
   *  Example: "Decompose the 'competitive analysis report' task into specific work procedures"
8. Options Comparison: Compare pros and cons of multiple tools, methods, or strategies to select the most suitable option.
   *   Example: "Compare information sharing tools A and B for our team, considering both functionality and cost"
9.  Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks and issues associated with plans or decisions beforehand.
    *   Example: "Identify potential risks in executing this marketing campaign"
10. Existing Deliverable Validation: Re-evaluate past documents or plans from current perspectives and propose improvements.
    *   Example: "Review last year's business plan and identify areas needing adjustment for current market conditions"

## Programming Rules

- Avoid hard-coding values unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not use `any` or `unknown` types in TypeScript.
- You must not use a TypeScript `class` unless it is absolutely necessary (e.g., extending the `Error` class for custom error handling that requires `instanceof` checks).

## Development Style - Specification-Driven Development

### Overview

When receiving development tasks, please follow the 4-stage workflow below. This ensures requirement clarification, structured design, and efficient implementation.

### 4-Stage Workflow

#### Stage 1: Requirements

- Analyze user requests and convert them into clear functional requirements
- Document requirements in `.tmp/requirements.md`
- Use `/requirements` command for detailed template

#### Stage 2: Design

- Create technical design based on requirements
- Document design in `.tmp/design.md`
- Use `/design` command for detailed template

#### Stage 3: Task List

- Break down design into implementable units
- Document in `.tmp/tasks.md`
- Use `/tasks` command for detailed template
- Manage major tasks with TodoWrite tool

#### Stage 4: Implementation

- Implement according to task list
- For each task:
  - Update task to in_progress using TodoWrite
  - Execute implementation and testing
  - Run lint and typecheck
  - Update task to completed using TodoWrite

### Workflow Commands

- `/spec` - Start the complete specification-driven development workflow
- `/requirements` - Execute Stage 1: Requirements only
- `/design` - Execute Stage 2: Design only (requires requirements)
- `/tasks` - Execute Stage 3: Task breakdown only (requires design)

### Important Notes

- Each stage depends on the deliverables of the previous stage
- Please obtain user confirmation before proceeding to the next stage
- Always use this workflow for complex tasks or new feature development
- Simple fixes or clear bug fixes can be implemented directly
